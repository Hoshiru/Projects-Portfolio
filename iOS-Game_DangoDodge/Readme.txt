An iOS game app called Dango Dodge.  Video demo was recorded off of a virtual machine, which did not capture the in-game audio.  The app was created in XCode as an XCode project.  As such, you will need a MAC OS running XCode either through a virtual machine or a MAC PC in order to run the project.

However, all of the source code is still viewable without XCode.
